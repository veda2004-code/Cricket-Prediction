# Cricket Player Performance Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the future performance of cricket players based on historical data and key attributes.

## Objective

To build a machine learning model that can estimate how a player might perform in upcoming matches, using factors like:
- Batting and bowling stats
- Strike rates and averages
- Wickets taken and centuries scored
- Match conditions and opposition strength

## Dataset

The dataset includes player statistics from past matches such as:
- Batting and bowling averages
- Strike rates
- Number of centuries and wickets
- Match and team conditions

## Approach

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: Identify and transform key performance indicators
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Understand patterns and distributions
- **Modeling**: Apply ML algorithms (regression/classification) to predict performance
- **Evaluation**: Assess using MAE, RMSE, and other metrics
